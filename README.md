This is a collection of scripts that I have written over the years to parse and manipulate genetic sequence data, usually in either FASTA or FASTQ format.

The scripts use the modules provided to parse FASTA or FASTQ. These are taken from the [QUASR](https://github.com/simonjwatson/QUASR) software suite.
